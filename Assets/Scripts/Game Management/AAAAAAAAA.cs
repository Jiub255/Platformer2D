	Make State Machine for movement. Do before movement script gets too involved. Maybe heirarchical?

	Finish/Completely redo Wall Jump/Slide. Look at some videos first. 

	DO THIS:
		Turn into different animals and be able to do different stuff. 
			Each animal will control differently, can make a super customizable movement script. 
			Each animal has special abilities. 
				ex. Bear knocks down walls, Mouse crawls through small holes, Bird flies over stuff. Plenty of possibilities. 
				Make a glide function for getting over long gaps. Like a flying squirrel. 





										   --------------
										   LESS IMPORTANT
										   --------------

	Try using ForceMode2D.Force and add smaller forces while button held (for a short time)? 
		Instead of cutting jump velocity? Try it out. 
        Make for higher jump if you hold down jump for like a half second or a small jump if you quickly tap jump. 

	Make a new Look/Move Action for the left analog stick, so that you can have a wide range be considered move left/right, 
		but only a narrow range be considered look up/down.
		For example, angles between 75 and 105 would be "Look Up". 
		Works fine already with discrete 4 directional inputs (WASD, arrow keys, D-pad). 
		Might need a separate class to handle that input, then send signals to either CameraLook or PlayerMovement depending.
