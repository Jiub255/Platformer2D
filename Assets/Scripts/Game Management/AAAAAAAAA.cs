	TODO:

	Make State Machine for movement. Do before movement script gets too involved. Maybe heirarchical? 

	FIX: 
		Jump happens on press but also on release. Changing to Jump.started didn't work, nothing registered as jump then. 

	Try using ForceMode2D.Force and add smaller forces while button held (for a short time). 
        Make for higher jump if you hold down jump for like a half second or a small jump if you quickly tap jump.
