	TODO:

	Make State Machine for movement. Do before movement script gets too involved. Maybe heirarchical? 

	FIX: 
		Jump happens on press but also on release. Changing to Jump.started didn't work, nothing registered as jump then. 

	Try using ForceMode2D.Force and add smaller forces while button held (for a short time). 
        Make for higher jump if you hold down jump for like a half second or a small jump if you quickly tap jump. 

	FIX: 
		Floating platforms move without you when you're on them. Make it so you move along with them. 

	Make a new Look/Move Action for the left analog stick, so that you can have a wide range be considered move left/right, but only a narrow range be considered look up/down.
		Like angles between 75 and 105 would be "Look Up". 
		Works fine already with discrete 4 directional inputs (WASD, arrow keys, D-pad). 
		Might need a separate class to handle that input, then send signals to either CameraLook or PlayerMovement depending.
